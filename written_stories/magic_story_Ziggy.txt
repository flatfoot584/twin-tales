One day, Ziggy found a mysterious fuzzy compass hidden inside a tree.
When they picked it up, a silly dragon appeared and said, "You must bring this to the Glitter Forest!"
Ziggy was nervous, but brave. They traveled through fog and thunder, facing the great tickle tornado.
In the end, they used the fuzzy compass to save the day, and made a new friend: the silly dragon!

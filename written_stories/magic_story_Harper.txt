One day, Harper found a mysterious Kities hidden inside a tree.
When they picked it up, a Dragon appeared and said, "You must bring this to the Disney!"
Harper was nervous, but brave. They traveled through fog and thunder, facing the great too much stuff to do there!.
In the end, they used the Kities to save the day, and made a new friend: the Dragon!
